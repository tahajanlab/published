Title: Crosstalk signaling between the epithelial and non-epithelial compartments of the mouse inner ear

Organism: *Mus musculus*

Experiment type: Single Cell RNA Sequencing using the Smart-seq2 protocol

Summary: The otolith organs of the inner ear consist of the utricle and saccule that detect linear acceleration. These organs rely on mechanosensitive hair cells for transduction of signals to the central nervous system. In the murine utricle, about half of the hair cells are born during the first postnatal week. Here, we report diverse cell-cell crosstalk among the 12 annotated cell populations in the developing neonatal utricle, including epithelial and non-epithelial cellular signaling. The mesenchymal cells are the dominant signal senders during the postnatal period. Epithelial to mesenchymal signaling, as well as mesenchymal to epithelial signaling, are quantitatively shown through the TGFÎ² and Pleiotrophin pathways. This study highlights the dynamic process of postnatal vestibular organ development that relies not only on epithelial cells, but also on crosstalk between spatial compartments and among different cell groups.
